    <string name="faq_android_clients">Multiple OpenVPN clients for Android exist. The most common ones are OpenVPN for Android (this client), OpenVPN Connect and OpenVPN Settings.&lt;p&gt;The clients can be grouped into two groups: OpenVPN for Android and OpenVPN Connect use the official VPNService API (Android 4.0+) and require no root and OpenVPN Settings which uses root.&lt;p&gt;OpenVPN for Android is an open source client and developed by Arne Schwabe.  It is targeted at more advanced users and offers many settings and the ability to import profiles from files and to configure/change profiles inside the app. The client is based on the community version of OpenVPN. It is based on the OpenVPN 2.x source code. This client can be seen as the semi officially client of the community. &lt;p&gt;OpenVPN Connect is non open source client that is developed by OpenVPN Technologies, Inc. The client is indented to be general use client and more targeted at the average user and allows the import of OpenVPN profiles. This client is based on the OpenVPN C++ reimplementation of the OpenVPN protocol (This was required to allow OpenVPN Technologies, Inc to publish an iOS OpenVPN app). This client is the official client of the OpenVPN technologies &lt;p&gt; OpenVPN Settings is the oldest of the clients and also a UI for the open source OpenVPN. In contrast to OpenVPN  for Android it requires root and does not use the VPNService API. It does not depend on Android 4.0+</string>

    <string name="ab_not_route_to_vpn">The configured client IP and the IPs in its network mask are not routed to the VPN. OpenVPN works around this bug by explicitly adding a route that corrosponds to the client IP and its netmask</string>
    <string name="ab_persist_tun">Opening a tun device while another tun device is active, which is used for persist-tun support, crashes the VPNServices on the device. A reboot is required to make VPN work again. OpenVPN for Android tries to avoid reopening the tun device and if really needed first closes the current TUN before opening the new TUN device to avoid to crash. This may lead to a short window where packets are sent over the non-VPN connection. Even with this workaround the VPNServices sometimes crashes and requires a reboot of the device.</string>

Unfortunately, omitting the less secure cipher suites and export cipher suites, especially the omission of cipher suites that do not support Perfect Forward Secrecy (Diffie-Hellman) causes some problems. This usually caused by an well-intentioned but poorly executed attempt to strengthen TLS security by setting tls-cipher on the server or some embedded OSes with stripped down SSL (e.g. MikroTik).\nTo solve this problem the problem, set the tls-cipher settings on the server to reasonable default like tls-cipher \"DEFAULT:!EXP:!PSK:!SRP:!kRSA\".

    <string name="faq_killswitch">It is often desired to block connections without VPN. Other apps often use markting terms like \"Killswitch\" or \"Seamless tunnel\" for this feature. OpenVPN and this app offer persist-tun, a feature to implement this functionality.&lt;p>The problem with all these methods offered by apps is that they can only provide best effort and are no complete solutions. On boot, app crashing and other corner cases the app cannot ensure that this block of non VPN connection works. Thus giving the user a false sense of security.&lt;p>The &lt;b>only&lt;/b> reliable way to ensure non VPN connections are blocked is to use Android 8.0 or later and use the \"block connections without VPN\" setting that can be found under Settings > Network &amp; Internet > Advanced/VPN > OpenVPN for Android > Enable Always ON VPN, Enable Block Connections without VPN</string>

    <string name="faq_ncp">There are some variation of this message depending on the exact situation. They all have in common that server and client could not agree on a common cipher. The main reasons are: &lt;ul>&lt;li> You are still relying on the fact that OpenVPN 2.4 and older allowed BF-CBC in the default configuration (if no --cipher was set). OpenVPN 2.5 does not allow it per default anymore since it is a &lt;a href="https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/SWEET32">broken/outdated cipher&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>&lt;li>The server runs OpenVPN 2.3 (or even older) with --enable-small (at least 4-5 year old OpenVPN)&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;/ul>Broken configuration (e.g., mismatching data-ciphers on client and server)&lt;/li> &lt;p> The &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/blob/master/doc/man-sections/cipher-negotiation.rst\">OpenVPN manual section on cipher negotiation&lt;/a> explains the different scenarios of cipher negotiation very well and what to do in these situation.&lt;p>TP-Link devices use a at least 5 year old OpenVPN 2.3.x version (possibly older) on their devices, even in the 2019/2020 models.&lt;p>Last but not least, there is a popular VPN provider that has a broken server that always says it is using \'BF-CBC\' because its developer thought it would be a good idea to create a proprietary cipher negotiation patch that is incompatible with standard OpenVPN.&lt;p>In summary: all sane configurations should not get these errors. But (apart from the broken VPN provider\'s server) the client can be persuaded to still connect (fixing the sympton and not the real problem). When connecting to older servers the comaptiblity mode option in the basic settings of a VPN should be able to address most of the common compatiblity problems.</string>
